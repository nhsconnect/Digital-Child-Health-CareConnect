This site is under active development by NHS Digital and is intended to provide the FHIR messaging components for the Digital Child Health event messages. This project is being developed using an agile methodology so iterative updates to content will be added on a regular basis, and remains subject to clinical review. Changes to this specification following the initial beta release will be documented here.
