## Background ##
Each event will carry a standard set of data to act as an event "header" (to help identify the patient, publisher, and actual event).

## The EMS Event Header Design ##

This standard header consists of the following items and their corresponding FHIR profiles and elements:

| Requirement                                                         | Cardinality                           | FHIR Profile                                                                                                                  | FHIR element                                                                |
