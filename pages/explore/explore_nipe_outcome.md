## FHIR Profiles ##

The following FHIR profiles are used to form the NIPE Outcome Event Message Bundle:

- [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle)
- [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Event-MessageHeader-1) - where the coding and display elements for the 'event' type are fixed to '​​nipe-outcome-1 \| ​NIPE outcome'
- [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1)
- [CareConnect-HealthcareService-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-HealthcareService-1)
- [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1)
- [CareConnect-Encounter-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Encounter-1)
- [CareConnect-Location-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Location-1)
- [CareConnect-Practitioner-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Practitioner-1)
