## FHIR Profiles ##

The following FHIR profiles are used to form the Allergies and Adverse Reactions Event Message Bundle:

- [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle)
- [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Event-MessageHeader-1) - where the coding and display elements for the ‘event’ type are fixed to ‘allergies-and-adverse-reactions-1 \| Allergies and Adverse Reactions’
- [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1)
- [CareConnect-HealthcareService-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-HealthcareService-1)
- [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1)
- [CareConnect-Encounter-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Encounter-1)
- [CareConnect-Location-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Location-1)
- [CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1)

## Allergies and Adverse Reactions Event data item mapping to FHIR profiles ##

This Mapping table defines the FHIR elements that SHALL be used to encode the Healthy Child Event Specification data items for each DCH Event Message payload.  
Some common data item mappings, such as patient, publisher or Date/Time of event information, are defined within the [Header mapping table](explore_event_header_design.html) and SHALL be considered in parallel with the payload mapping.

The Child Health Event data items are fulfilled by elements within the FHIR resources listed below:

<table>
<tr><th>DCH Data Item</th><th>FHIR resource element</th><th>Mandatory/<br/>Required/<br/>Optional</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><td>Date/Time Recorded</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.assertedDate</td><td>Mandatory</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Causative Agent</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.code</td><td>Required</td><td>Where a SNOMED CT code for a Causative Agent is not available, then code.text should be used to contain a text representation of the Causative Agent</td></tr>
<tr><td>Description of Reaction</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.reaction.manifestation.coding</td><td>Optional</td><td>When no code manifestation coded value is available, a description of the manifestation should be entered in manifestation.code.text</td></tr>
<tr><td>Type Of Reaction</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.type</td><td>Optional</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Certainty</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.verificationStatus</td><td>Optional</td><td>Use the mapping defined in the verificationStatus valueSet (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/allergy-verification-status) to find the actual values to flow). When no code for Certainty is available (or a more detailed certainty description is needed), a free text representation in CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.note should be sent*</td></tr>
<tr><td>Severity</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.reaction.manifestation.severity</td><td>Optional</td><td>Use the mapping defined in the CareConnect-ReactionEventSeverity-1 valueSet (https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/ValueSet/CareConnect-ReactionEventSeverity-1) to find the actual values to flow. When no code for Severity is available (or a more detailed severity description is needed), a free text representation in CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.note should be sent*</td></tr>
<tr><td>Evidence</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.note*</td><td>Optional</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Date First Experienced</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.onset</td><td>Optional</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Comment</td><td>CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1.note*</td><td>Optional</td><td></td></tr>
</table>                                                                                                  
*Rather than split descriptive and user entered text across a number of note fields the AllergyIntolerance.note element is used as the single notes field to convey all qualifiers and user-entered text associated with the allergy or intolerance in a single place. Qualifiers and values expressed as text MUST be appropriately labelled and formatted and where user notes have been entered against explicit fields such as certainty then appropriate labels MUST be used.
