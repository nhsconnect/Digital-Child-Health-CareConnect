summary: "The FHIR profiles used for the Educational History Event Message Bundle"

- [DCH-MessageHeader-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/DCH-MessageHeader-1) - where the coding and display for the event element is fixed to 'CH032 - Educational History'
- [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1)
- [DCH-HealthcareService-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/DCH-HealthcareService-1)

- [CareConnect-DCH-Encounter-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-DCH-Encounter-1)
- [CareConnect-Location-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Location-1)
- [DCH-EducationalHistory-QuestionnaireResponse-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/DCH-EducationalHistory-QuestionnaireResponse-1)
- [DCH-ProfessionalComment-Communication-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/DCH-ProfessionalComment-Communication-1)

- [DCH-RelatedPerson-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/DCH-RelatedPerson-1)

### Educational History Event data item mapping to FHIR profiles ###

This Mapping table defines the FHIR elements that SHALL be used to encode the Healthy Child Event Specification data items for each DCH Event Message payload.  
Some common data item mappings, such as patient, publisher or Date/Time of event information, are defined within the [Header mapping table](explore_event_header_design.html) and SHALL be considered in parallel with the payload mapping.

The Child Health Event data items are fulfilled by elements within the FHIR resources listed below:

| DCH Data Item                                | FHIR Resource element                                                             | Mandatory/Required/Optional |             |
