oding and display for the event element is fixed to 'CH018 - Observations'

### Observations Event data item mapping to FHIR profiles ###

This Mapping table defines the FHIR elements that SHALL be used to encode the Healthy Child Event Specification data items for each DCH Event Message payload.  
Some common data item mappings, such as patient, publisher or Date/Time of event information, are defined within the [Header mapping table](../explore_event_header_design.html) and SHALL be considered in parallel with the payload mapping.

The Child Health Event data items are fulfilled by elements within the FHIR resources listed below.

| Professional Name        | CareConnect-DCH-Practitioner-1.name                           | Mandatory                   |                                    |
| SDS Job Role Name        | CareConnect-DCH-PractitionerRole-1.code (SDS Job Role Name)   | Mandatory                   |                                    |
| Encounter Type           | CareConnect-DCH-Encounter-1.type (childHealthEncounterType)   | Mandatory                   |                                    |

Observation measurement data items are fulfilled as Observation.valueQuantity elements within separate instances of a FHIR Observation resource.

All Observations are Required

Profiles used by each Observation type are listed below.
