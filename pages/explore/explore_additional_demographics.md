## FHIR Profiles ##

The following FHIR profiles are used to form the Additional Demographics Event Message Bundle:

- [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle)
- [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Event-MessageHeader-1) - where the coding and display elements for the 'event' type are fixed to 'additional-demographics-1 \| â€‹Additional Demographics'
- [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1)
- [CareConnect-HealthcareService-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-HealthcareService-1)
- [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1)
- [CareConnect-Encounter-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Encounter-1)
- [CareConnect-Location-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Location-1)

## Additional Demographics Event data item mapping to FHIR profiles ##

This Mapping table defines the FHIR elements that SHALL be used to encode the Healthy Child Event Specification data items for each DCH Event Message payload.  
Some common data item mappings, such as patient, publisher or Date/Time of event information, are defined within the [Header mapping table](explore_event_header_design.html) and SHALL be considered in parallel with the payload mapping.

The Child Health Event data items are fulfilled by elements within the FHIR resources listed below:

| DCH Data Item            | FHIR resource element                                 | Mandatory/Required/Optional |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Local Patient Identifier | CareConnect-DCH-Patient-1.identifier (localIdentifier) | Mandatory                   |
| Local Patient Identifier assigning Organisation| CareConnect-DCH-Patient-1.identifier(localIdentifier).assigner | Required                   |
| Town of Birth            | CareConnect-DCH-Patient-1.birthPlace                  | Required                    |
| Date and Time            | CareConnect-DCH-Encounter-1.period.start              | Required                    |
| Country of Birth         | CareConnect-DCH-Patient-1.birthPlace                  | Required                    |
| Patient email address    | CareConnect-DCH-Patient-1.telecom.value               | Required                    |
| Ethnicity <br> see table below             | CareConnect-DCH-Patient-1.ethnicCategory              | Required                    |
| Religion                 | CareConnect-DCH-Patient-1.religiousAffiliation        | Required                    |


### Ethnic categories mapping table ###

Ethnicity recording in Digital Child Health is requested to use the reduced 16+1 Ethnic Category list.
However, CareConnect-Patient-1 has a required binding to the [CareConnect-EthnicCategory-1 valueset](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/ValueSet/CareConnect-EthnicCategory-1).  
The following mapping SHOULD be used to map the ethnicCategory value to the reduced valueset.

<table>
<tr><th>16+1 valueSet</th><th>Mapping to PDS valueSet</th></tr>
<tr><td>A - British, Mixed British</td><td>A - British, Mixed British</td></tr>
<tr><td>B - Irish</td><td>B - Irish</td></tr>
<tr><td>C - Any Other White Background</td><td>C - Any other White background<br/>C2 - Northern Irish<br/>C3 - Other white, white unspecified<br/>CA - English<br/>CB - Scottish<br/>CC - Welsh<br/>CD - Cornish<br/>CE - Cypriot(part not stated)<br/>CF - Greek<br/>CG - Greek Cypriot<br/>CH - Turkish<br/>CJ - Turkish Cypriot<br/>CK - Italian<br/>CL - Irish Traveller<br/>CM - Traveller<br/>CN - Gypsy/Romany<br/>CP -Polish<br/>CQ - All republics which made up the former USSR<br/>CR - Kosovan<br/>CS - Albanian<br/>CT - Bosnian<br/>CU - Croatian<br/>CV - Serbian<br/>CW - Other republics which madeup the former Yugoslavia<br/>CX - Mixed white<br/>CY - Other white European, European unspecified, European mixed<br/></td></tr>
