## FHIR Profiles ##

The following FHIR profiles are used to form the Developmental Skills Event Message Bundle:

- [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle)
- [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Event-MessageHeader-1) - where the coding and display for the event element is fixed to "​developmental-skills-1 \| ​Developmental Skills"
- [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1)
- [CareConnect-HealthcareService-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-HealthcareService-1)
- [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1)
- [CareConnect-Encounter-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Encounter-1)
- [CareConnect-Location-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Location-1)
- [CareConnect-Condition-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Condition-1)
and
- [CareConnect-RelatedPerson-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-RelatedPerson-1)
or
- [CareConnect-Practitioner-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Practitioner-1)
- [CareConnect-PractitionerRole-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-PractitionerRole-1)

## Developmental Skills Event data item mapping to FHIR profiles ##

This Mapping table defines the FHIR elements that SHALL be used to encode the Healthy Child Event Specification data items for each DCH Event Message payload.  
Some common data item mappings, such as patient, publisher or Date/Time of event information, are defined within the [Header mapping table](explore_event_header_design.html) and SHALL be considered in parallel with the payload mapping.

The Child Health Event data items are fulfilled by elements within the FHIR resources listed below:

<table>
<tr>
<th>DCH Data Item</th><th>FHIR resource element</th><th>Mandatory/<br/>Required/<br/>Optional</th><th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date first achieved</td><td>CareConnect-Condition-1.onsetDateTime</td><td>Required</td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date of observation</td><td>CareConnect-Condition-1.assertedDate</td><td>Required</td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date of enquiry</td><td>CareConnect-Encounter-1.period.start</td><td>Required</td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Developmental Skill</td><td>CareConnect-DevelopmentalSkill-Condition-1.code</td><td>Required</td><td>If a coded value does not exist for the Development Skill then the element "code.text" can be used</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Result of observation/enquiry</td><td>CareConnect-Condition-1.stage.summary</td><td>Mandatory</td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Comments</td><td>CareConnect-Condition-1.note</td><td>Optional</td><td></td>
</tr>
</table>
