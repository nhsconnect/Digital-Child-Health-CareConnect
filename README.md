# Digital Child Health Events #

This **temporary** site is provided to assist with the development of the **Beta** Digital Child Health Events Specification and is being updated regularly. It is advised not to develop against these specifications until a formal announcement has been made. Note: The [current published Digital Child Health Events Specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/Digital-Child-Health/Generated/Chapter.1.About/index.html) is the **Alpha** version published on the NHS Developers Network.

## Introduction ##

**What is a Child Health Event?**

Events contain information meaningful to those managing the personal health of themselves or their families, those professionals providing direct care to children and young people and those managing the health of populations.

The information contained within an event is recorded within clinical interventions or occurrences that happen throughout a clinical pathway or patient journey. These clinical interventions or occurrences are referenced throughout the catalogue and are classed as a form of clinical contact either as part of the Healthy Child Programme which is a planned intervention as part of the pathway, or unplanned such as a visit to a GP or Emergency Department. 

To ensure the aims of this strategy are met and small manageable segments of data are interoperable the events catalogue breaks up the much larger Clinical Interventions/Occurrences into smaller, more manageable 'events'.
